In the first GreatMigration Lab, we looked at the conditions of people (particularly African American people) who *lived* in a southern state.  This week, we will look at people who were *born* in a southern state and we'll compare the characteristics of southern born people **who no longer live in the south** with those who continue to reside in the state of their birth. In other words we're going to compare *migrants* with *non-migrants*. To be more tediously precise, we're going to compare the characteristics of migrants with those *at risk of migrating* in other words with the universe of people born in the particular state (actually, as we'll see, it's a bit more complicated than that).\n", "\n", "The data that we will use in this week's exercise is very similar to what we used in the first Great Migration lab.
